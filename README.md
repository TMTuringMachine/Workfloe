We are using GitHub for the following reasons:

- Collaboration: GitHub makes it easy to share code with others and helps a lot in collaboration.
- Setting up the project: GitHub makes it easy to set up a project and get started.
- Implementing the CI/CD workflow: GitHub makes it easy to implement the CI/CD workflow and makes the deployment process easy.
- Deploying the project: Deploying the project on GitHub helped us to get the project deployed on the network to be accessed by other people. It helped us to host our server through our github repo to sustain CI/CD pipeline.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Complete our entire project under the given time constraint but not giving up on quality. Wrote reusable clean code with component and hooks pattern.
- Implemented JWT from scratch for authentication with taking care of two user profiles: Admin and Employee.
- Handling active / disabled status of employee while not letting employee access the platform.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Completing the project within the given time frame.
- Implemented all the features mentioned in the given problem statement.
- Completing the Admin and Employee portal.
- Implementing Different types of charts.

## 📖 What we learned

- Use of external library: Recharts for making different charts
- Implementing small small details such as form validation, greeting messages, auth status etc

## 🚀 What's next for workfloe
